# MindGrid - Real-Time Collaboration Platform

MindGrid is a real-time collaboration platform built to enable seamless teamwork, just like Notion. It allows users to collaborate, brainstorm, and organize thoughts in real-time, all while offering a smooth and intuitive experience. Whether you're working on projects, documents, or creative ideas, MindGrid makes it easy to stay in sync with your team. 

Built with modern web technologies like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), MindGrid leverages the power of server-side rendering and a scalable architecture to handle real-time collaboration with speed and efficiency.
